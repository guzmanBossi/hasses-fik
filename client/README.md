## Project Overview

The Balanced Chef project is built using Astro.js, a modern front-end framework that allows for efficient static site generation. The codebase is organized into different directories, each serving a specific purpose. Let's take a closer look at the main directories and their functionalities:

### `src/components`

The `src/components` directory contains reusable UI components used throughout the project. These components are designed to be modular and customizable, promoting code reusability and consistency in the user interface. From buttons and forms to navigation elements and recipe cards, the `components` directory houses the building blocks of the application's visual elements.

### `src/layouts`

The `src/layouts` directory includes layout components that define the overall structure of the pages. Layout components provide a consistent structure for different sections of the application, such as the header, footer, and sidebar. By separating layout concerns from page-specific content, this directory facilitates easy maintenance and updates to the overall application structure.

### `src/pages`

The `src/pages` directory is where the main pages of the application reside. These pages include the home page, recipe details page, meal planning page, and more. Each page is designed to provide specific functionality and an engaging user experience. Through the use of Astro.js's static site generation capabilities, the pages are optimized for performance and SEO.
